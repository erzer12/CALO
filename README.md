# CALO
CALO (City as a Living Organism) is a web-based AI system that analyzes public city data like complaints, weather, search trends, and news to explain a city’s current health, why issues are emerging, and what might happen next. It uses AI reasoning, not IoT, and presents insights in simple, human-readable form.
